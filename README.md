# Student Net

A student net for students of The University of Winnipeg.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

**Note**: You can skip any of these prerequisites if you have them installed already.

#### Git

Follow the instructions on [Git docs](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to download and install `git` for your system.

#### Docker

Follow the instructions on the [Docker Engine docs page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to download and install `Docker` for your system (i.e. Windows, Mac, etc).

To check you've set it up correctly, run `docker --version` and it should be one of the later versions, i.e. `^20.10`.

**Note**: You don't really need to fiddle much with Docker for this project since it is mostly just a tool that helps you set up a development environment. Although, Docker is required for Docker Compose to work and that's something you'll use in this project.

Useful docker commands are available at the [`docker` CLI docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/).

#### Docker Compose

Once you have Docker, follow the instructions on the [Docker Compose docs page](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to download and install `Docker Compose` for your system.

Also, `docker-compose` is available through PyPi. You can download it by running `pip3 install docker-compose`.

To check you've set it up correctly, run `docker-compose --version` and it should be one of the later versions, i.e. `^1.25`.

**Some important docker-compose commands**

-   `docker-compose up -d`: Starts the services (as a _daemon_, aka in the background) described in the `docker-compose.yml` file located in the same directory.
-   `docker-compose down`: Stops the services described in the `docker-compose.yml` file located in the same directory.
-   `docker-compose ps`: Lists the services that exist currently. Note that it shows all services regardless of whether it is dead or alive.
-   `docker-compose logs -f --tail 10 <service>`: Streams the 10 recent-most lines of logs of a particular service. This is very helpful for debugging when some of your services die (terminate) unexpectedly. Note that if you `<Ctrl-C>` to exit the log stream it will **not** stop the services, rather only the logs.
-   `docker-compose restart <service>`: Restart a given service. Helpful if some service just died and you want to try breathing life into it.
-   `docker-compose build <service>`: Builds a given service as described by the context Dockerfile from the description of the service in the `docker-compose.yml`

-   More commands available in the [`docker-compose` CLI docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/).

### Student-Net NextJS + MySQL Project (Development Environment)

1. Clone this repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/UWCodeForce/student-net.git
```

2. Navigate to the directory: `cd student-net`

3. Create a .env file inside of the `cd web` directory.

    ```sh
    DB_HOST=db
    DB_USER=root
    DB_PASS=root
    DB_DATABASE=studentnet
    DB_PORT=3306
    ```

    The host should be set to db if using the Docker compose. If running the services manually, use localhost instead.

4. Start the Docker containers

    ```sh
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

5. To **view the site** in the development mode, **navigate to `http://localhost:3000` **from a browser.

6. Try changing some of the HTML/CSS/JS content in `./web/pages/_app.js` (or wherever really, as long as it is inside `./web`) to see live changes on the page.

    In fact, any changes you make to the files in `student-net/web/` will automatically trigger a re-render of the page from within your Docker container so you **don't have to start/stop any server or even refresh the page**. Sometimes, it may happen that you break some part of the app and save the file. For example, if you have `<di>Forgot a 'v' in 'div'. Oh no!</div>` in your code it will cause the app to break.

    In such a scenario, just **correct the file and reload** the page. This should fix the error and start the live-reloaded page should start working like previously.

    **Note**: When you wish to take a break from working on this project, you **don't have to shut down any servers** either.

    To shut down all the services, just run:

    ```sh
    docker-compose down
    ```

    This will keep your changes to the files but should you choose to discard them, it is as easy as running `git restore <file>` on files you don't want to keep the changes for.

7. Don't forget to keep committing your updates as you keep changing/adding new content to this NextJS app.

8. Done! You've successfully set up the development environment for the Student Net project in a few simple steps.

    Now it is time to write some code! :sunglasses:

#### (Optional) Peek into the sample container

    ```sh
    docker run --rm -it aalekhpatel07/student-net:js /bin/bash
    ```
    Then `ls` (or `dir` for Windows) to see the contents of the container. This is where your code is run. The serving port of this container and your local host are connected (i.e. *bound*) virtually through `- ports` section in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

    This allows you to make an HTTP request to the internal network of the docker container through `localhost:3000` of your host machine.

### Student-Net NextJS + MySQL Project (Production Environment)

Update the `docker-compose.prod.yml` file with the credentials and run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d` to access the production version of the site at `http://localhost/`, which then you can expose to the rest of the internet by forwarding ports 80/443 from your wifi router to the server that you run this command in.
